			<br> 
			I downloaded a book on html5 and decided to work on it a bit. Added css script, second page, and some "input". Also learned how to comment and what not.

			<br>
			Added the dicegame.

			 Improved look (relatively). Played around with dice game. Starting to add screen shots of updates. Changed the fonts. Added some colors. Starting to look like it's not from 90's.
